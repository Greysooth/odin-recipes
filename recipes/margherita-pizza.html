        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Margherita pizza is a classic Italian dish that celebrates simplicity and freshness.<br>
             Originating from Naples, it features a thin, chewy crust topped with a vibrant tomato sauce made from San Marzano tomatoes, creamy fresh mozzarella cheese, and fragrant basil leaves.<br>
              A drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil and a sprinkle of salt finish the pizza, highlighting the natural flavors of each ingredient.<br>
               The red tomatoes, white mozzarella, and green basil are said to represent the colors of the Italian flag, making Margherita pizza not only delicious but also a symbol of Italian pride and tradition

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
             <li>1 batch pizza dough (homemade or store-bought, about 1 pound)</li> 
             <li>1 large can (28 ounces) whole San Marzano tomatoes or good-quality canned tomatoes</li> 
             <li>8–12 ounces fresh mozzarella cheese, torn or sliced</li> 
             <li>Handful of fresh basil leaves</li>
              <li>2 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling</li> 
              <li>2 small garlic cloves (optional, for sauce)</li> 
              <li>½ teaspoon sea salt or kosher salt, plus more for sprinkling</li> 
              <li>Red pepper flakes (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>If making dough from scratch, combine flour, yeast, water, salt, and olive oil. Knead until smooth and let rise until doubled in size (about 1–2 hours). Alternatively, use store-bought dough and let it come to room temperature.</li> 
            <li>Pour the canned tomatoes (with juice) into a bowl. Crush by hand or pulse in a food processor with olive oil, garlic (if using), and salt until smooth.</li> 
            <li>Preheat your oven to 500°F (260°C) or as hot as it will go. Place a pizza stone or baking steel on the upper rack if you have one.</li> 
            <li>On a floured surface or parchment paper, stretch or roll the dough into a 10–12 inch round. Transfer to a baking sheet or pizza peel dusted with cornmeal.</li>
            <li>Spread about ½–¾ cup of tomato sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a 1-inch border around the edges. Distribute mozzarella evenly over the sauce. Drizzle lightly with olive oil.</li>
            <li>Bake the pizza on the top rack (or on a preheated stone/steel) for 10–12 minutes, until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbling and just turning golden.</li> 
            <li>Remove from the oven. Top generously with fresh basil leaves, a drizzle of olive oil, and a sprinkle of salt. Add red pepper flakes if desired. Slice and enjoy.</li>
        </ol>
