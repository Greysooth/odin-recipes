        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Samosa is a popular Indian snack featuring a crispy, golden pastry filled with a savory mix of spiced potatoes, peas, and sometimes meat.<br> 
            Triangular in shape and usually deep-fried, samosas are enjoyed hot with tangy chutneys, making them a favorite street food and party appetizer across South Asia.<br>
             Their flaky crust and flavorful filling offer a delightful contrast in every bite. Loved for their versatility, samosas are perfect for tea-time, festive occasions, or as a satisfying snack anytime.

             <li>1 tablespoon ginger (minced or finely chopped)</li> 
             <li>1–2 green chilies (chopped, optional)</li> 
             <li>1 teaspoon cumin seeds</li> 
             <li>1 teaspoon garam masala</li> 
             <li>1 teaspoon chili powder</li> 
             <li>1/2 teaspoon amchur (dry mango powder) or lemon juice</li> 
             <li>1/2 teaspoon fennel powder (optional)</li> 
             <li>1/4 teaspoon hing (asafoetida, optional)</li> 
             <li>Salt to taste</li> 
             <li>2 tablespoons chopped coriander leaves (cilantro)</li> 
             <li>Oil for deep frying</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, mix 2 cups all-purpose flour, 1 teaspoon carom seeds, and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Add 4 tablespoons oil and rub it into the flour until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs.</li> 
            <li>Gradually add about 6 tablespoons water, kneading until a firm, smooth dough forms. Cover and let it rest for 30 minutes.</li> 
            <li>For the filling, heat 2 tablespoons oil in a pan. Add 1 teaspoon cumin seeds and let them splutter.</li> 
            <li>Add 1 tablespoon ginger, 1–2 chopped green chilies (optional), and a pinch of hing if using. Sauté for a minute.</li> 
            <li>Add 3–4 boiled and mashed potatoes and 1/2 cup green peas. Stir well.</li> 
            <li>Mix in 1 teaspoon garam masala, 1 teaspoon chili powder, 1/2 teaspoon amchur or lemon juice, 1/2 teaspoon fennel powder (optional), and salt to taste. Cook for 2–3 minutes.</li> 
            <li>Add 2 tablespoons chopped coriander leaves and mix. Let the filling cool completely.</li> 
            <li>Divide the dough into equal balls. Roll each into an oval, cut in half to form two semi-circles.</li> 
            <li>Shape each semi-circle into a cone, sealing the edge with water. Fill the cone with potato mixture, then seal the top edge to close the samosa.</li> 
            <li>Heat oil for deep frying. Fry samosas on medium heat until golden and crisp. Drain on paper towels and serve hot with chutney.</li> 
        </ol>
